1. What are the differences between JIT and AOT? And examples.
- JIT stands for Just In Time. JIT complier provides compilation during the execution of the program at run time. Code get compiles when it's needed, not at the build time.
- AOT stands for Ahead of Time. AOT complier provides compilation during the build time before browser downloads and runs that code.
- differences:
    - JIT complies code excatly before displaying in the browser, while AOT complies code while building application
    - Loading AOT is quicker than JIT because it already has complied code at build time.
    - Bundle size of JIT is higher than AOT
    - Implementing features and debugging is easy in JIT mode since we can catch template binding error at display time.

2. What is single page application?
- An SPA (Single-page application) is a web app implementation that loads only a single web document, 
- and then updates the body of content of that single document via JavaScript APIs and Fetch when differe content is to be shown.
